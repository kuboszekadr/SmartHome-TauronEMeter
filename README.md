# SmartHome-TauronEMeter

Simple class allowing user to download data from Tauron smart meter. Simply create config.ini file with username, password and meter number to be able to download data from the Tauron service. By default script downloads day x-1 since tauron does not at the moment provide live data (or at least I haven't found any yet)
